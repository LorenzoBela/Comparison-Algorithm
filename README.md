# üîç AI-Enhanced Excel Data Comparison Tool

An intelligent Python tool designed for the **HRMIS JoPayroll Backlog process** to compare consolidated payroll master lists with system-generated reports. This tool uses advanced rule-based matching combined with AI semantic similarity for borderline cases.

## üìã What This Tool Does

This script compares two datasets containing employee information with the following columns:
- **Name**: Employee full name
- **Position**: Job title/position
- **TIN**: Tax Identification Number
- **Pay**: Net pay amount

The tool performs **10 different verification passes** and uses **AI semantic similarity** to make intelligent matching decisions for cases where traditional rules are insufficient.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `Comparator.py`: Main Python script
- `requirements.txt`: All required Python packages
- `Simpler.xlsx`: Sample Excel file for testing
- `README.md`: This documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Python 3.10+ recommended)
- **Internet connection** (for first-time AI model download)
- **Excel file** with data in the correct format

## üì¶ Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Check if Python is Installed

Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:
```cmd
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script files:
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\Lorenzo Bela\Downloads\Comparison Algorithm"
```
*Replace with your actual folder path*

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

**Option A: Install everything at once (Recommended)**
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B: Install packages individually**
```cmd
pip install pandas>=1.5.0
pip install numpy>=1.21.0
pip install openpyxl>=3.0.0
pip install sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
pip install rapidfuzz>=3.0.0

```

**Note**: Some packages are optional. If any package fails to install, the script will still work with reduced functionality.

## üìä Excel File Format Requirements

Your Excel file should have data arranged as follows:

### Layout Example:
```
Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E | Column F | Column G | Column H | Column I
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Name1    | Pos1     | TIN1     | Pay1     |          | Name2    | Pos2     | TIN2     | Pay2
GARCIA,  | ADMIN    | 123-456- | 50000.00 |          | GARCIA,  | ADMIN    | 123456789| 50000.00
JUAN     | ASST III | 789      |          |          | JUAN C.  | ASST 3   |          |
...      | ...      | ...      | ...      |          | ...      | ...      | ...      | ...
```

### Default Column Ranges:
- **Dataset 1**: Columns A:D (Name, Position, TIN, Pay)
- **Dataset 2**: Columns F:I (Name, Position, TIN, Pay)
- **Column E**: Should be empty (separator)

### Important Notes:
- No headers are required (first row is treated as data)
- Both datasets should be on the same Excel sheet
- Empty rows are automatically ignored
- Names cannot be empty (will be excluded from comparison)

- **AI Usage**: How many decisions required AI analysis

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "File not found" Error
```
‚ùå Error: File not found at [path]
```
**Solution**: 
- Check the file path is correct
- Use `.\filename.xlsx` for files in the same folder
- Use full path like `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\file.xlsx`

#### Python Not Found
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution**:
- Try `py` instead of `python`
- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH" during installation

#### Package Installation Fails
```
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError
```
**Solution**:
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Use `pip install --user package_name`
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

#### AI Model Download Issues
```
‚ùå Failed to load AI model
```
**Solution**:
- Ensure internet connection is available
- The model will download automatically on first use (~90MB)
- Try running Option 7 to test AI model loading

#### Memory Issues with Large Files
- Close other applications
- Use a smaller sample of your data first
- Consider using Option 6 for verification analysis only

### Performance Tips:
- **Small files** (< 1000 records): All options work quickly
- **Medium files** (1000-10000 records): AI analysis may take a few minutes
- **Large files** (> 10000 records): Consider using verification analysis first

## üîí Important Security Notes

- This tool is designed for **HRMIS JoPayroll Backlog process**
- Handle confidential payroll data responsibly
- Do not share this script outside the Data Warehouse and Analytics Division
- Review the disclaimer before each use
- Ensure data files are stored securely
